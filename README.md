# RCA_AIG_042Q6_ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE
# Goal & Aims
This course is designed to provide a basic grounding of AI 

* The aim is to equip students with the Data Science skills in order to complete basic IoT-scenario's. 
* Providing students with templates and a data-toolkit (code), which can be implemented through popular single board microcontrollers (Arduino / Raspberry Pi).

# Requirerment

# Scope
A hands-on introductory course that prpovides a roadmap for building AI 

Creating your own IoT data pipeline https://github.com/robvdw/CMIDAT01K-DATA-SCIENCE-for-IOT/blob/master/IoT-Pipelines/data_pipeline%20example01.png

# Learning objectives
* Become familiar with Data Science concepts surrounding IoT applications
* Prepare a (Rapid) prototype for an Internet of Things (IoT) data-pipeline scenario's
* Learn to design and develop simple lightweight IoT-prototypes
* Learn to report on IoT projects (inclusive prototypes + data-pipelines).
