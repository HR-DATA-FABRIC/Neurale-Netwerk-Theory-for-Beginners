# ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI) [RCA AIG 042Q6]
# Goal & Aims
This course is designed to provide a basic grounding of AI from a Cognitive Neuroscience perspective.

* The aim is to equip students with basic Data Science skills ---including Python coding--- to build or explain next-gen Machine Learning (ML) data-products.
* It will provide students with in-depth knowledge about state-of-the-art AI coding frameworks & libraries [AI platforms] such as:

    * AWS machine learning
    * Cafee, Keras
    * Matlab
    * Mathematica
    * Microsoft 
    * Cognitive Toolkit
    * Sci-Kit Learn
    * Pytorch
    * Tensorflow
    * Theano
    * Torch

* Particular attention will be paid to the knowledge domain of Human Cognition form the view point of Cognitive Neuroscience.

# Scope
A hands-on grounding of modern AI.

The course provides a roadmap for building conceptual prototypes of Human-Centered (HC) data-products by means of AI-platforms. 

AI platforms comprise software tools to build, deploy, and monitor machine learning algorithms. 
It involves the use of Data Science (DS) & Machine Learning (ML) models & algorithms to perform tasks that otherwise would be performed solely by humans. 

AI platforms aim to mimic & automatise tasks which otherwise require human perception, cognition and/or motor skills:

* pattern recognition, 
* learning, logical reasoning & planning, 
* decision making, problem solving, 
* designing, 
* creativity, 
* likelihood estimation, 
* language acquisition,
* multi-sensory interfacing, 
* actuated body movement control
* locomotion & manipulation
* sentiment analysis
* generalisation

Thus, AI platforms combine automated human perception, cognition and/or motor skills with data, thereby enabling the creation of novel data products. 
Some platforms offer prebuilt ML algorithms and simplistic DS visualisation workflows with such features as drag-and-drop modeling and visual interfaces that easily connect necessary data to the end solution, while others require a greater knowledge of development and coding. 
Machine learning is a popular subset of data science that warrants specific attention when evaluating these platforms.

HC data products are digital products that use AI platforms to visually support decision-making and help humans control complex systems. 
Generally, a data product is the visually processed result, with the help of ML-algorithms, of complex data analysis of systems.
 
Data products aim to make Wicked Problems accessible to humans.  
* contain many interdependent influencing variables 
* do not have right or wrong solutions, only good and bad ones 
* can’t be solved with a formula and logic alone 
* can only be solved intuitively, not logically 
* are defined by social, psychological and cultural aspects.

The course covers handling of small-scale Neural Network (NN) datasets and aim to equip stundents with coding skills. 
Python will be the primary language of the course and while we do not expect you to have full proficiency in it.
We expect students at the end of the course to be able to read, (re)write & test Phyton code.
Lectures + coding examples will become availabe during the course itself.



# Learning objectives

* Become familiar with Cognitive Neuroscience & ML-based Data Science (DS) concepts surrounding AI data products.
* Learn to design, develop and test lightweight AI implementations by means of AI-platforms.
* Learn to report on AI projects/scenario's from a Cognitive Neuroscience perspective (inclusive prototypes + data-pipelines + ethical considerations).
