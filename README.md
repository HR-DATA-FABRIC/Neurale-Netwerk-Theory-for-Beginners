# ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE [RCA AIG 042Q6]
# Goal & Aims
This course is designed to provide a basic hands-on grounding of AI from a Cognitive Neuroscience perspective.

* The aim is to equip students with basic Data Science skills ---including Python coding--- to build or explain next-gen AI-applications.
* It will provide students with in-depth knowledge about state-of-the-art AI frameworks & libraries ---such as AWS machine learning, Cafee, Keras, Matlab, Mathematica, Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit, Sci-Kit Learn, Pytorch, Tensorflow, Theano, Torch--- 
* Partticular attention will be paid to the knowledge domain of Human Cognition form the view point of Cognitive Neuroscience.

# Context & Topics
This course is an adapted version of a lecture series as devised and setup for HRBS by Renske van den Engel-Brands; called  ArtificiÃ«le Intelligentie maakt deel uit van de Rotterdam Career Academy. Vrije keuzedeel, richting Business IT Management. Studielast bedraagt 30 ECTS.

Topics: Human Agents / Machine Learning / Deep Learning / Perceptron / 


# Scope
A hands-on introductory course that provides a roadmap for explaining & building AI applications. 
Lectures + coding examples will become availabe during the course itself.

# Learning objectives
* Become familiar with Cognitive Neuroscience & ML-based Data Science (DS) concepts surrounding AI applications
* Learn to design, develop and test lightweight AI implementations by means of DS and Python coding.
* Learn to report on AI projects from a Cognitive Neuroscience (inclusive prototypes + data-pipelines + ethical considerations).

# Lessons
The content of each lesson will become avaiable each week as a PDF document via: https://github.com/robvdw/RCA_AIG_042Q6_ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE/
