# ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE [RCA AIG 042Q6]
# Goal & Aims
This course is designed to provide a basic grounding of AI.

* The aim is to equip students with the Data Science skills in order to describe and implement basic  machine learning (ML-)based AI-scenario's. 
* Providing students with in-depth knowledge and data science knowledge, which can be implemented through popular AI frameworks & libraries such as AWS machine learning, Cafee, Keras, Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit, Sci-Kit Learn, Pytorch, Tensorflow, Theano, Torch

# Requirerment

# Scope
A hands-on introductory course that provides a roadmap for explaining & building AI 

Creating your own IoT data pipeline https://github.com/robvdw/CMIDAT01K-DATA-SCIENCE-for-IOT/blob/master/IoT-Pipelines/data_pipeline%20example01.png

# Learning objectives
* Become familiar with Machine learning (ML) Data Science (DS) concepts surrounding AI applications
* Learn to design and develop simple lightweight AI implementation
* Learn to report on AI projects (inclusive prototypes + data-pipelines + ethical consoderations).
